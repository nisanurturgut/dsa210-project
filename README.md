# Daily Spotify Listenings & Weather Analysis

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze the relationship between **daily Spotify listenings** and **weather conditions** (sunny, rainy, cloudy, etc.). The goal is to uncover patterns in music preferences based on weather. By analyzing this data, we seek to determine if weather influences mood and music choices.

## Key Questions
1. How do music preferences change based on weather conditions (e.g., sunny, rainy, cloudy)?
2. Are there certain genres or moods gravitated towards depending on the weather?
3. Can patterns in Spotify listening behavior related to specific weather events be identified?

## Data Sources
- **Spotify Listening Data**: Includes information about tracks, artists, and listening timestamps.
- **Weather Data**: Contains daily weather conditions for the corresponding dates.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python**: Data analysis and visualization.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive coding environment.
- **APIs**: Used to fetch weather data.

## Results
The project explores potential correlations between weather conditions and music preferences. Key findings include:
- [Example: Increased listening to acoustic tracks on rainy days.]
- [Example: Preference for upbeat genres on sunny days.]

## Future Improvements
- Incorporate more detailed weather data (e.g., temperature, humidity).
- Expand the analysis to include multiple users.
- Explore machine learning models for predictive analysis.
